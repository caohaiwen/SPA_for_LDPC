# SPA_for_LDPC
this repository is about the implementations (using C and Matlab) of the sum-product algorithm for LDPC (a.k.a Low-Density Parity-Check) code under some different symmetric channels including Binary Symmetric Channel, Binary Erasure Channel and AWGN ( Additive White Gaussian Noise) Channel.

Thanks for [David J. C. MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._C._MacKay) providing these (almost) regular LDPC matrix files in [his LDPC codes database](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/codes/data.html).
